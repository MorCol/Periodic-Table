# Periodic-Table
Electronic Periodic Table

Pretty much what it says on the tin.

This is a very basic C++ project using simple search functions to look through the txt file.

If you encounter any bugs then please let me know, it's pretty far from robust!

I am currently in the process of building a GUI for this project (wish me luck)

Feel free to fork and steal as much code as you want!
